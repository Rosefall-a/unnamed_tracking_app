# Plugin Gateway Authentication

The deployed host/runtime path uses authenticated private HTTP with
`PLUGIN_RUNTIME_TOKEN`. Workers use the mediated JSON-line Plugin API and never
receive this token. See [platform architecture](plugin-platform.md) for version,
correlation, error and transport behavior.

The bootstrap/session identity design below is implemented by the contract library
and tested independently. It is not currently the runtime's deployed credential
provisioning path; its in-memory credential store is not a durable production store.

## Identities

The core application has a stable application_id. The plugin gateway has a separate stable gateway_id. Both identities are explicitly carried by the bootstrap request and response.

The configured gateway URL, hostname, IP address, Docker service name, or network reachability is never treated as proof of identity.

## Bootstrap credential

The core provisions a high-entropy bootstrap credential. The gateway stores only a keyed digest of the credential and binds it to the application identity.

Credential material is returned only at issuance and is never retained by the credential store. Bootstrap credentials have a bounded lifetime and may be rotated or revoked.

## Replay protection

Every bootstrap request contains a UUID nonce and an issued-at timestamp. The gateway rejects requests outside the configured clock-skew window and records each nonce atomically through the credential-store contract. A reused nonce is rejected even when the bootstrap credential remains valid.

A durable CredentialStore implementation is required for production so credential revocation and replay state survive gateway restarts. The repository includes an in-memory implementation for tests/development only.

## Session credentials

A successful bootstrap produces a separate short-lived session credential bound to the same application identity and gateway identity. Session credentials are independently revocable and rotatable.

Consumers of the bootstrap library must present session credentials on subsequent
requests. The production runtime bridge instead presents its dedicated runtime token.
Neither path treats a URL as proof of identity.

## API version selection

The bootstrap request advertises supported Plugin API major versions. The gateway selects v1 only when it is explicitly offered; otherwise bootstrap fails rather than silently downgrading.

## Request context

RequestContext includes gateway_id alongside application_id, plugin identity, installation identity, user context, request ID, and capability. This prevents a request from omitting which gateway authenticated it.

## Production runtime transport

The application communicates with its configured `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_URL` using
`PLUGIN_RUNTIME_TOKEN`. Runtime-originated requests carry that token back to the
configured `PLUGIN_GATEWAY_URL` at `/api/plugins/runtime/gateway`; browsers and
plugins never receive it. Each request preserves a supplied UUID or receives a
runtime-generated UUID, plus persisted plugin/installation identity and host user
context. JSON-line responses preserve structured host errors and legacy SDK fields.

## Security boundary

The implementation does not expose database credentials, environment variables, filesystem paths, Docker objects, or application secrets to plugins. Installation identities and permission grants are persisted and checked by the production gateway.

Gateway trust remains separate from plugin-owned storage. Possessing a runtime token authenticates the transport but does not satisfy a plugin capability grant.
