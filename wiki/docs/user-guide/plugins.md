# Plugins

Plugins are independently packaged `.utp` extensions. An administrator installs and updates them from **Settings → Plugins**.

## Installation consent

1. Select a package, enter a public package URL, or choose an enabled catalogue entry. A harmless filename-extension mismatch is allowed because the archive content is inspected.
2. The host verifies the archive and shows plugin identity, version, publisher trust, dependencies, UI contributions, and every requested permission.
3. Review each permission and its rationale. Permissions default to denied.
4. Unsigned or unknown-key packages require a separate acknowledgement. An invalid signature is blocked.
5. Highly privileged grants to an unverified package require administrator password re-entry and explicit dangerous-capability confirmation.
6. Confirm installation. The host installs, activates, and reports the initial health result.

Preview and package validation never execute plugin code. Activation happens only after validation, dependency checks, permission review, any required reauthentication, and the explicit commit. Denied capabilities stay unavailable even if they appear in the manifest.

## Pages and settings

Enabled plugins may add host-owned sidebar routes under `/plugins/{plugin_id}/{page_id}`. Native extensions can appear only in allowlisted host slots. A custom frontend runs in a sandboxed iframe and cannot access host cookies, local storage, Vue state, or the host DOM.

Choose **Settings & access** on an installed plugin to open its Overview, Settings, Permissions and Diagnostics tabs. Plugin-provided application pages contain their functionality and server/profile configuration. Installation and management dialogs follow the selected light/dark palette, support keyboard focus and Escape, and use larger phone controls. Permissions show total scopes and host-classified risk bubbles only for categories actually requested; selecting a parent selects its requested descendants. Secrets are write-only: saving replaces the value, but neither the browser nor later API responses can read it back.

Browse Installed, Updates Available, Available to Install and All, with search and plugin-supplied tag filters. All includes enabled catalogues and installed plugins. Selecting an installed plugin for installation offers update/reinstall/replace/cancel explicitly.

## Revoking or removing access

Stop/start, disable/enable, restart, update, rollback and normal reinstall preserve
plugin data, configuration and secrets. Reinstall replaces the exact installed
release; it never selects a newer release automatically. Uninstall and confirmed
reinstall-with-purge erase owned state. Revoked permissions can be explicitly
granted again without reinstalling.

Automatic installation has global and per-plugin controls and applies only to
catalogue installations. Individual releases may opt out. Downloaded updates
remain distinct from installed versions, new scopes require approval while the
old version runs, and failed activation restores the previous package. Retained
package history is configurable and independent of plugin data.

Revoking a grant takes effect on the next gateway request. Disable stops the plugin and removes its pages/slots. Uninstall stops it, removes its package and private plugin storage, and revokes its notification-provider registrations. Updates are previewed before replacement, show changelog/dependency/permission changes, and cannot silently acquire newly requested permissions. Administrators can check configured sources for updates; available updates appear in the existing notification feed.

The reference plugins demonstrate [document viewing](../development/reference-plugins.md#scoped-document-viewer), [self-service sessions](../development/reference-plugins.md#self-service-session-manager), and [external notification delivery](../development/reference-plugins.md#external-discord-delivery-provider).
